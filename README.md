This is the current iteration of a project completely written by Gemini 2.5 pro as directed by me. Basically every piece of writing in this project besides this document was written by Gemini 2.5.

I am a complete novice at coding. I have zero knowledge. Use of this software is completely at your own risk as it was 100% written by AI.

I left all of the development documentation available. See summary4.txt for the most recent breakdown and goals.

To install, git clone https://github.com/adampdxdotcom/GeordiLogger and the docker compose up -d.
Currently the app only runs on my local machine. If you get it running, you will need to point it to an Ollama instance.
